<b> TutorialsPoint: Social Networking </b>
<br>
<br>
Social networking is when a group of people, organizations, or companies come together to voice thoughts, and opinions, and do activities together on a social server.
Some of the most popular social networking servers are Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Faceparty, Linkedin, Flickr, Ibibo, WhatsApp, Line, and Hike. 
These are the top 10 social networking mobile apps that connect people from all around the world. 
Some of these applications are messenger apps that allow one user to send a message to another user or within a group, while other applications are able to send photos, videos, and audio along with messages. 
Social networking has grown popular to help in many ways. 
It helps with online marketing for businesses and entrepreneurs, finding jobs and sending applications online, spreading awareness and news online, 
keeping in contact with friends and family all around the world, having the ability to share photos, videos, and audio.

<b> Creating Social Media Pages </b>
<br>
<br>
Since 6 of these activities are tutorials on how to sign up and create an account on different social media that I already have an account on I decided that I will write a review of which are my favorite to use and why. 
My favorite social media pages are Snapchat, Instagram, and Pinterest, in that order. This is also the order in which I use them most to least in. 
I enjoy Snapchat and use it the most because it's a chatting app, which allows you to send photos and videos to your friends and family or post it on your "story". 
You can also make phone or face calls which is a feature I use a lot with my friends who have androids.
I'm not much of a texter, so I prefer to record video and audio messages, or call my friends rather than type out a big message. Snapchat makes it super easy to do this with my friends who don't have an iPhone. 
Instagram is my second favorite because of how much I can learn through the accounts I follow. Unlike Snapchat, this app is not secluded to only your friends and family and has a much broader accessibility to people all around the world. You can also make posts that stay on your profile, instead of deleting after 24 hours. 
Pinterest is my last favorite app because I'm a very visual person and I love creating vision boards for any chance I can.
Whether it's goals I want to accomplish, places I want to visit, styles I want to acquire, or inspiration for remodeling my room, Pinterest helps me find the proper photos I want to use to help with my vision boards. 
It helps me organize my thoughts visually and print them out so I can put them on my corkboard in my room.
