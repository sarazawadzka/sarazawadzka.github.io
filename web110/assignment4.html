<b> Tutorialpoints: Email Overview </b>
<br>
<br>
Email is a system we can use that allows us to send an electronic message over the internet in real-time. You use an email address to send or receive these messages. The email has a few different pieces in it.
It has an email header, which includes "From, Date, To, Subject, Cc (Carbon Copy),". A greeting, text, and signature. SMTP, or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is the standard protocol to send emails well and reliably.
There is also IMAP, Internet Message Access Protocol, which allows the user to create, edit, delete, or move the email. Pop, Post Office Protocol, is used for one person and allows offline mail checking. The emailing system is easy to use, its function is to "receive, store and deliver the email." 
This reading was very educational. I got to learn a lot about email, its history, and the way it works. I will put it to use the next time I write one!

<b> Send, Recieve, and Respond to Email </b>
<br>
<br>
It was fun to mess around with sending, receiving, and responding to emails. I got to learn a few things like creating a signature for my email, adding links to emails, and you can insert emojis into emails.
I think that this is sort of like the first social media, a way for people to communicate online and be able to send each other photos, links, articles, etc etc. This activity has changed my viewpoint on the use of email, I have always thought of it as a serious thing but now looking at it, it's like a messaging app.

<b> View Email Message Headliner </b>
<br>
<br>
In this activity, I learned that there are people who will try to scam your email by not only spamming but also by phishing, a form of scamming by trying to get users to send their personal information or to download a virus. 
To avoid such scams, the user must know how to check the full header, with this you can trace back to the original email. To do this is very simple, next to a "reply all" button there is a button that says "more" with three dots, you click that button and click "show original". The headers will pop up in a new window
with a lot of new information like the authentication of where the email came from. You may also download this to view the full header. I think this is important to know especially in today's day and age where everything is online.
