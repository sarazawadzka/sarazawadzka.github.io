Internet Technologies <br>
I learned about Intranet, which is a private network of computers inside of an establishment wthat has it's own server and firewall. It is a system where lots of Pc's are connected together but have no connection to theoutside world of the Intranet. Each of these companies have their own network that their employees can use. There is also the Extranet, which unlike the Intranet, is a system of networks that uses Internet to connect to outsiders in a more controlled way. This helps the businesses get in touch with their customers and suppliers. It's a simpler way for them to work together. I think these systems are important to know since I plan on doing graphic design and web developement in the future and will probably be using them in the future.<br>

Keyboard Shortcuts <br> 
Although some of these I already knew, such as "ctrl & c" for copy or "ctrl & p" for paste, there are a few new short cuts that I learned in this tutorial. These shortcuts are: <ol>
  <li>"ctrl & a" to select all text </li>
  <li> "ctrl & f" to find a word </li>
  <li> "ctrl & alt & del" to quit a frozen app </li>
  <li> "ctrl & n" to open a new file </li>
</ol> <br> There are a lot more shortcuts I learned in this tutorial but I will not be writing them all out. I'm interested in these and although these are simple little shortcuts I will definetly start to incorporate them more in my daily use of my laptop.<br>

Does IP Address (Geolocation) Really Work? 
Yes they do. IP addresses are a georeference, a geolocation system uses a large computer database to map the address. These can be very helpful for businesses to keep track of the locations of visitors to their websites, find spammers online, and eeven help law enforcement track people who may "illegally swap media files on the internet". However, there are limitations to how accurate the geolocation system is. Sometimes it's inaccurate due to potentionally having a wrong location, sometimes it's only connected to a major city instead of a street address or sometimes IP addresses don't even show up in databases. I think this is very interesting, I have never really known much about how IP addresses work or how they are mapped. I think it's important for everyone to know more about the instruments we use on a daily basis. <br>
