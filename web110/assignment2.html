Different Browser Web Review <br>
Trying out different internet browsers was interesting and after spending a few minutes playing around on each browser I have decided that Opera GX is my favorite. 
I prefer this browser over the other ones due to the large selection of modifications and customizations it has compared to browsers such as Google Chrome or Fire Fox.
<ol> Opera GX has <br>
<li> differnt appearances and themes that you can customize to your liking with a larger selection then other browsers with more vibrant colors and introcate patterns </li>
<li> a verticle sidebar with a variety of extensions that come with such as the GX Cleaner, which cleans up your browser to make it run faster from bugs or viruses. You can also add extensions such as social media or chat apps.</li> <br>
<li> fun browser sounds or background music </li><br>
  <li> little animations pop up on your screen while using the browser </li>
</ol><br>

These customizations may not sound all too appealing to someone who isn't interested in a visual experience, but it fits my artistic personality more then a plain browser. I got to learn a lot about all these customizations and will spend more time playing around with them the more I use the browser. <br>
