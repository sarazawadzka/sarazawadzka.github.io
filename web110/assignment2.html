<b>Different Browser Web Review </b>
<br>
Trying out different internet browsers was interesting and after spending a few minutes playing around on each browser I have decided that Opera GX is my favorite. 
I prefer this browser over the other ones due to the large selection of modifications and customizations it has compared to browsers such as Google Chrome or Firefox.
<ol> Opera GX has <br>
<li> different appearances and themes that you can customize to your liking with a larger selection than other browsers with more vibrant colors and intricate patterns </li> <br>
<li> a verticle sidebar with a variety of extensions that come with such as the GX Cleaner, which cleans up your browser to make it run faster from bugs or viruses. You can also add extensions such as social media or chat apps.</li> <br>
<li> fun browser sounds or background music </li><br>
<li> little animations pop up on your screen while using the browser </li>
</ol><br>
These customizations may not sound all too appealing to someone who isn't interested in a visual experience, but it fits my artistic personality more than a plain browser. I got to learn a lot about all these customizations and will spend more time playing around with them the more I use the browser. <br>

<b>Who Doesn’t Love A Plugin? Here’s How To Do A Great Installation Job </b>
<br>
Before this class, I did not know what a plug-in was. I learned that a plug-in is a software that allows your computer to run videos, music, or games. Not only did I learn how to download a plug-in, but I also learned that in the past you had to download these if you wanted to watch anything or play any music. Most computers and browsers were not built to be able to play those things without this additional software. 
I think it's pretty cool that this technology has evolved enough that now these software are built into our browsers and are capable of running these things on their own without the need to download extra equipment. Knowing this will let me appreciate the simplicity of modern technology more, things are so easy to use that most people don't have to know the specifics of how softwares or programs work. <br>

<b>HTML5 Accessibility </b>
<br>
HTML5 is the new and updated version of HTML. It is the software that has replaced the need to download plug-ins to watch videos, listen to music, play games, etc. It allows us to build more complex websites/games and also allows us to use them. 
In this article, I learned that Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are the most up-to-date with this advanced technology. It also teaches its readers the specific features that each browser has accessible to its users. Microsoft Edge is the only browser that has 100% accessibility on these features, with Google Chrome in second with 98.5%, Safari in third with 97%, Firefox in fourth with 94%, and Internet Explorer with 56%. 
I think this is important to know, especially which program has access to which individual feature if you work with computers, design, social media, or even in school. After COVID-19, most things have become more, if not only, available online, and being able to use certain programs or visit certain websites is vital to our everyday lives.
