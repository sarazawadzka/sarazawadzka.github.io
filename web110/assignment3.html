<b> Tutorialspoint: Search Engines </b>
<br><br>
Search Engines are big databases that can find information on the World Wide Web. It uses websites, images, programs, etc, to find things that the user is looking for. 
The way it works is a user types in a query, and the search engine then looks within its resources for any information that has to do with the search and brings it back to the user.
For a search engine to work it needs databases, web crawlers, and a search interface.
Web crawlers are little bots that search the web for information. Search interfaces are the way a user can look through the database.
For the Search Engine to process this information, it uses a method called the Index Process; which identifies and stores documents to turn into index terms, which are then turned into data structures to support the user's fast searching. 
I think this is good information to know, and it will help me find better searches when I'm looking for something on Google or Bing.

<b> Web Search Engine Compare </b>

During this comparison activity, I noticed that Google and Yahoo were very similar in layout and search results. They had the same result pop up just in a slightly different order. While Bing and Ask had similar results but different layouts. 
Ask had the most unique layout, at the top of the page starting with a big ad for Amazon, then following connections to different search engines, a few articles that weren't very relevant to the search, and then the same results as the other search engines. 
Bing also started with an ad at the top of the page and a large display for Wikipedia. I think Google has the best layout. It has information on both sides of the screen and seems to have the most relevant information coming up. 
I usually use Google due to having Google Chrome, however now I will be using it over other search engines due to the simpler layout, the lack of ads, and better references.

<b> Learn about SEO </b>
<br>
<br>
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a program that uses keywords to generate traffic to your website, makes your site easier to search, uses other sites to build links, and is also used to market your web page. 
It's an awesome tool to get more flow to your page. The way to get the best results is to get the search engine to notice you. This happens when crawlers find your site and add the information to their Index. To get a good ranking you need to have pieces of information that will answer the search engine's query. When having a business that is a good way to draw traffic to your page, my brother uses this for his pest control business and it has helped a lot with getting clientele.
My goal is to learn more about it so I can use it for my jewelry website.
