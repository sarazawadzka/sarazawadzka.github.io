 I think this chapter is a little more difficult for me due to how much vocabulary there is to remember. I have never heard of most of these things so I wanted to rewrite them in my own words so I'm able to understand and remember everything better in the future. 
I think it's interesting to learn more in depthly about things that we use on a daily basis but from a technical perspective. I'm curious to see how this will help me in the future since I want to get into graphic design and further my knowledge in web developement.

The video chat feature is very handy for talking to friends who don't have an iPhone and I'm unable to Facetime with. 
The app has IRC integrated into it's server to look out for posts involving the words when users try to sell nudes or narcotics. Anyone who makes posts with certain
