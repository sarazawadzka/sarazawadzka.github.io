<b> TutorialPoints: Internet Services </b>
<br>
<br>
Internet Services allow us to access copious amounts of information over the internet. 
<br> <ol> 
There are four categories of Internet Services:
  <li> Communication Services </li> 
  <ul> <Li>Electronic mail: send mail over Internet  </Li>
    <li> Telnet: allows access to a remote computer attached to the internet </li>
    <li> Newsgroup: a forum where people can discuss topics </li>
    <li> Internet Relay Chat (IRC): worldwide communication in real-time </li>
    <li> Mailing lists: "organizes a group of internet users to share common information through email"  </li>
    <li> Internet Telephony (VoIP): enables users to communicate through the internet with any PC that can receive calls </li>
    <li> Instant Messaging: allows users to chat in real-time </li> 
  </ul>
  <li> Information Retrieval Service </li>
  <ul><li> File Transfer Protocol (FTP): allows file transfer </li>
  <li> Archie: "updated database of public FTP sites + contents"  </li>
    <li> Gopher: allows user to "search, retrieve, and display documents on remote sites" </li>
    <li> VERY EASY RODENT ORIENTED NETWIDE INDEX to COMPUTER ACHIEVED (VERONICA): is a Gopher resource, that allows users to have access to Gopher sites. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Web Services: allows easy interaction between apps. </li>
  <li> World Wide Web (WWW / W3) allows the user to access different documents that may contain text, video, photo, audio, and hyperlinks - which allow navigation between the documents. </li>
</ol>
 I think this chapter is a little more difficult for me due to how much vocabulary there is to remember. I have never heard of most of these things so I wanted to rewrite them in my own words so I'm able to understand and remember everything better in the future. 
I think it's interesting to learn more in-depth about things that we use daily but from a technical perspective. I'm curious to see how this will help me in the future since I want to get into graphic design and further my knowledge in web development.

<b> VoIP / Messaging + Use of Snapchat </b>
<br>
<br>
Online Chatting: text-based communication between one or more users done in real-time <br>
Chat Slang: rules that are supposed to be followed when chatting with another user online <br>
Instant Messaging (IM): a software that allows users to message one another with text messages, photos, or other files.<br>
Internet Relay Chat (IRC): a protocol that is a defined set of rules to have in communications between a server and a client. <br> 
Video Conferencing: the use of two-way screen and audio calls to communicate between two different users. <br>
Video Sharing: an IP Multimedia system (IMS) that allows audio calls that stream a user's screen as well. <br> 

Snapchat is a social media app that has been around for about a decade if I remember correctly, 
at first, it started with only being able to send photos and videos with a caption directly on the image but now it has evolved into a more modern application that has everything listed above besides screen sharing. 
In recent updates, Snapchat has developed online chatting and video conferencing, or as the app calls it, a video chat. They also have audio calls as well as online chatting now. I think these features are really cool and I use them daily. 
The video chat feature is very handy for talking to friends who don't have an iPhone and I'm unable to Facetime with them. 
The app has IRC integrated into its server to look out for posts involving the words when users try to sell nudes or narcotics. Anyone who makes posts with certain vocabulary gets flagged and can get their account deleted, unable to use the same phone, phone number, or email to create another account.
I'm not sure if other things will get flagged and deleted, I know if an account gets reported enough times for something it can also be deleted with the same consequences. I'm intrigued to see what else this app as well as other ones do to modify their services as time goes on. 
I feel as though there may not be much left to do to add but these apps come out with more things every year and I'm looking forward to seeing what else they'll come up with.

<b> Screen Sharing/ Remote Desktop </b><br>
<br>

Chrome Remote Desktop is a software tool that permits a user to control another computer's desktop remotely using a specialized protocol. Unfortunately, I do not have another computer to try this with, but the other day I was struggling with downloading 
Adobe Photoshop on my laptop was not working no matter how many times I tried to install the app. I called customer service and got transferred to a guy who worked in the tech department. He had me log onto a page and download software just like this one.
He was able to use my computer as if he were sitting right next to me and using my mouse and keyboard! It was super cool and kind of freaky at the same time. He was able to download the proper software and change some things within my settings and folders that allowed me to properly download the app and use it. 
It was a very fascinating experience. After he finished, he gave me a way to opt out of the remote sharing software and delete it from my computer. I am a bit worried that maybe someone would be able to somehow hack into my computer through this though, would it be possible?
