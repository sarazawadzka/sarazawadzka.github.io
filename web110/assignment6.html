 I think this chapter is a little more difficult for me due to how much vocabulary there is to remember. I have never heard of most of these things so I wanted to rewrite them in my own words so I'm able to understand and remember everything better in the future. I think it's interesting to learn more in depthly about things that we use on a daily basis
