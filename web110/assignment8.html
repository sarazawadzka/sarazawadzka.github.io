<b> Internet Safety </b>
<br>
Internet safety is something necessary to learn in this day and age. It is very important to create strong passwords, shop safely online, avoid scams, and get to know how good the security is on the browser you use. Creating strong passwords can be difficult to come up with on your own, but most of the time your device generates a strong password when you create a new account so it takes the pressure off a bit. Every browser already has some built-in security.  It is still possible for your computer to catch viruses or enter spam/scam websites that take your information.
To avoid this, the user must be cautious of the web pages they go on and enter their private information into. Blocking malware can be pretty simple to do. It's best to use antivirus software for your computers. Another way is to avoid 
any suspicious links or sites. To shop safely online is very important, it is best recommended to shop from your home network, look for HTTPS, research the company/seller, use secure payments, and keep a record of all purchases. 
There are a few more subjects that are written about in the article that are also important such as understanding social media privacy and understanding digital tracking. These are all really important things that everyone should know and learn about and I'm glad that this was a section 
that we had to read through. I knew most of the information that was written but there were also a few things that I didn't know prior and that I'm glad I got to learn about.

<b> Opera: Guide to Security and Privacy  </b>
<br>
This article gave me a lot of insight into how to control more of what is going on with the privacy of my browser. I already had the ad blocker turned on, as well as the tracking blocker. While reading the article, I learned how to turn on the VPN and what exactly a VPN does. It is used to block third parties from being able to track me on shared networks.
It also talks about incognito mode, security badges, managing security certificates, as well as warnings that the browser will give you when Opera cannot identify the webpage you are trying to enter or when it identifies a scam or spam. I'm grateful for the information that I didn't know before, it gives me a better insight as to how my browser works for the future.

<b> Password Managers and Multi-Factor Authentification </b>
<br>
These are two software that I have been using for a while now. A password manager is software that keeps track of all your passwords and can also be used to generate new ones when you create new accounts. 
Multi-factor authentication is a type of software where you enter your login information and it keeps the information safe by blocking access to logging in unless you enter a code the software generates. They're both very useful to have and the authentification application has saved me a few times from being hacked! 
I would recommend people to use them.
