<b> Internet Safety </b>
<br>
Internet Saftey is something important to learn in this day and age. It is very important to creating strong passwords, 
shop safely online, avoid scams, and getting to know how good the security is on the browser you use. Creating strong passwords can be difficult to come up on your own, but most of the time your device offers 
you a strong password when you create a new account so it takes the pressure off a bit. Every browser already has some built in security but it is still possible to get viruses or enter spam/scam websites that take our information.
In order to avoid this, the user must be causious of the webpages they go on and enter their private information into.
