<h1>Painting</h1>
<h3>My Favorite Hobby by Sara Zawadzka</h3>
<p>Painting has been my favorite hobby for as long as I remember. I have been going to a private art studio since the age of 4. The teachers at this studio was a married couple from Poland, they started out the studio in their basement and it eventually big enough to them purchasing a location of their own for the business. They taught me many things in many different forms of art, like pottery, sculpting, wood carving, drawing, and of course painting. Oil painting has become my favorite over the years, but I do still paint in acrylic, gouache, or watercolor from time to time.
Painting is my favorite because I really enjoy the process of mixing the paint together to find the perfect color and then adding the color to the blank canvas and filling it until an image forms. It is one of the only things that I can sit and truly focus on. Painting bringss me a peaceful state of mind that I rarely get from anythng else. </p>

<center> Here is a photo of me with some of my art when is was being displayed at The Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown Chicago. I was an employee at the restaurant on the first floor of the museum and one of the people that owned a wall wanted to give back to the museum by showcasing art from the museum employees. It was a very surreal moment for me and is one step closer to my dream of having a full display of my art hanging up at a museum. The big piece is my first oil paiting, it is named "The Chaotic Ballerina". I named it thing because I imagine that the swirl of color around her are bundled emotions that she feels and uses to push herself harder to be a better performer. The twoo small pieces are acrylic paintings. The one on the left is named "The Eye of Nature", it was a very fun painting to creat and I practiced thickening the acrylic and stacking it to create a thicker texture that you can feel when you touch the painting. The last painting on the right is named "Deer Skull". It was my first time trying out a monochromatic style of painting, I was 15 years old when I painted it.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

These paintings are all made from acryic paint and were a set that I did as an interpretation of life and death, in fact that was actually the name of the set. "Life & Death". The one on top I named "Memento Mori", which stands for "remember death, or remember you will die" in Latin. The second one is named "Memento Vivere", which stands for "remember life, or remember to live". The last one was "Convictus", which stands for "coexistance". <br /><br /><br /><br /></center></center>
