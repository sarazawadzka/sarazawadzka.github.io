<b> HTML </b>
<br>

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. I like to think of HTML as a language used to accessorize websites. It helps with their appearance and organize the content. 
There are multiple versions of HTML; HTML 1.0-4.0, XHTML, & HTML5. 
Tags are orders that tell the web browser how to showcase the text, audio, graphics, or videos. 
They are created with angle brackets, they end by putting a forward slash in the closing tag.
Forms are used to enter values. These are than sent to the server to be processed. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, this helps estblish the presesntation of HTML by creating a separate file with the .css extension. 
Javascript is a lightweight programing language "with object- oriented capabilities that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages". It is a more advanced website building language. 
PHP is Hypertext Preprocessor is used for developing web based software application, it is a scripting language that is embedded in HTML. Web developers use it to manage content, databases, session tracking and also building entire e-commerce sites.
I think it's so cool how there are multiple coding languages that you can use to design depending on level of expertise. I have experience in HTML, I had a hobbie in coding using HTML when I was 11-15 years old. It's been almost a decade since I used it but I still remember 
some things from it. Learning about these other languages is intriging and I'm looking forwrd to getting to code something myself.

I have been going to a private art studio since the age of 4. The teachers at this studio was a married couple from Poland, they started out the studio in their basement and it eventually big enough to them purchasing a location of their own for the business. They taught me many things in many different forms of art, like pottery, sculpting, wood carving, drawing, and of course painting. Oil painting has become my favorite over the years, but I do still paint in acrylic, gouache, or watercolor from time to time.</p>
