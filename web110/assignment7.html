<b> Internet Reference Models </b>
<br>

Reference Model is a standard of technology that is used around the world to show how devices can be used by anyone despite their construct. 
There are two types of reference models; the OSI model, which is used as a hypothetical model, and the TCP/IP, which is the practical model. 
<ol> OSI Model <br>
<li> Stands for Open System Interface. </li> 
<li> Has 7 layers. <br> The Physical Layer, in charge of maintaining the physical connection between the device and the transmission medium.
  <br> The Data Link Layer handles communication and error control between the other layers.
  <br> The Network Layer divides segments into network packets and then puts them back together at the receiving end as well as finding the best path through a physical network to route packets. 
  <br> The Transport layer manages the network traffic to ensure proper and complete data transfers.
  <br> The Session Layer controls the conversations between computers.
  <br> The Presentation Layer prepares data for the application layer.
  <br> The Application layer has protocols that allow the software to send and receive information and present data to users.
</li></ol>
<ol> TCP/IP Model
<li> Stands for Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol </li>
<li> Has 4 layers. <br> Application Layer, is the same as the OSI Application layer.
  <br> Transport Layer is the same as the OSO Transport layer.
  <br> Internet Layer, allows the host to insert packets into the network and then make them travel by themselves to their destination.
  <br> Host to Network Layer is a combination of OSI Physical and Data Link Layer.

  This was interesting to learn about, I don't think I'll ever have to use this information but I enjoy learning more about the science behind our everyday technology.

<b> Review IP Address Settings </b>
<br>
The first step to reviewing the IP Address is checking your internet and making sure that it is working properly. This is something I do pretty often. Rebooting the internet is quite easy. 
All you do is click on the internet icon, turn off the wifi, and turn it back on (or turn on airplane mode and turn it back off) to let the wifi reboot. Changing the TCP/IP setting is something I've never done before. 
The directions were pretty easy to follow and I was able to mess around with the settings for a bit. I didn't know some of the information to put in so I wasn't able to go much farther than that but this is all very good information to know for the future!

<b>  Research costs of licenses for Windows, MacOS, Linex </b>
<br>
Linex is a freely available source. Windows is free if you update from Windows 10 to Windows 11, however, I did find something that costs $139 to purchase off the Microsoft website.  
MacOS is free with the purchase of any Apple computer, it has free upgrades as well however it is not possible to download the MacOS on any non-Apple computer.
